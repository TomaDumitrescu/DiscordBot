# Description

Bot name: Sam
Visibility: private


Features:

- play command: connects to the voice channel and plays the song
given as parameter, if the song name is correct
Example:
!play silence.mp3

- list command: displays the available songs
Example:
!list

- scram command: the bot will leave the channel instantly
Example:
!scram

- event handler for on_voice_state_update: if the bot is left alone
on the voice channel, then automatically will leave

- event handler for on_member_join: when a member joins, a random
greet message will be displayed for that member. Five messages are
possible and the one displayed is chosen by a random number from 1-5

# Debugging tool:

code.interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))

# Notes:

- To add more songs, install files and put them in songs library

- For new environments, modify the global setup variables. This
method will lead to an easier setup for anyone who installs the
bot (for example, some paths may differ from the original project
configuration)

- Bot token is secret, because having access to it grants permissions
to perform maliciously actions on every Discord server where it is present
